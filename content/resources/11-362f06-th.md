description: Photograph of a colorful mural in a Dorchester neighborhood. This class
  examined possible redevelopment scenarios for a 3-acre piece of land in Boston's
  underserved Dorchester neighborhood.  Highlighting the strengths of this neighborhood,
  such a rich history and good schools, was an important part of the process. (Photograph
